# l4d2-server
# What is this?

It's a project to deploy a server for playing L4D2 with your friends. It is stressful, exciting, and fun.

# Why is this?

Because I saw that seen in World War Z with the hordes of zombies and wanted to play a game around it.

# How is this?

The project leverages Terraform and Docker to spin up a server in less than five minutes. To make this work, you'll need the following things:

- A basic understanding of git (how to pull, add and commit)
- A basic understanding of docker (how to add, build and push images)
- Git, Docker, and Terraform installed on your computer
- The google cloud sdk installed on your computer, linked to a account with a credit card
- A copy of Left 4 Dead 2

# Make it so

Clone this respository. `cd` into the repository directory, then run `terraform init`

You'll need to update the following parts of the "main.tf" file.
